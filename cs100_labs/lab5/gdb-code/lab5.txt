Values before delete
at line 30
src = "hello"
dst = "goodbye"

at line 32
src = "hello"
dst = "hello"

Values after delete
at line 33
src = "hello"
dst = ""

then the null terminator '\0' should be put in the last spot in array.
The delete statement should be removed because there is no reason to delete the array that was just constructed.
